Mittens is a Shapeshifting humanoid cat creature. They can change into any form of their choosing. Mittens was kicked out of the werewolf pack because they were cats. Now they have joined the OC crew just because they were bored. Mittensâ€™ shapeshifting abilities are mostly in their control, unless he sneezes, who knows what will happen when they do that.
